# Denotational Semantics

I added some additional features (language extensions) to the basic definitions in the continuation semantic model (Impc). I used same test cases and added own test cases. In addition I added Goto sequencer and Leave methods.

Environment
===========
	- The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 7.10.3
	- Sublime Text Editor

Following features are added:
