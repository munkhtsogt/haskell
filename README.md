# Denotational Semantics

Added some additional features (language extensions) to the basic definitions in the continuation semantic model (Impc). I used same test cases and added own test cases. In addition I added Goto sequencer and Leave methods.

Environment
===========
	- The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 7.10.3
	- Sublime Text Editor
	- Command: "ghc --make Tests.hs & ./Tests"
 
Following features are added:
<ul>
	<li>Static Binding</li>
	<li>Single Parameter</li>
	<li>Goto</li>
	<li>Leave</li>
	<li>Loop</li>
	<li>Run (Read)</li>
	<li>Draw</li>
</ul>
